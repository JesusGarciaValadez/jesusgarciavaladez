          Iâ€™m a developer since 2009 at a marketing and development agency. I begin as a front-end dev but, I also did
          some basic back-end tasks since then. I learned about
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">JavaScript</strong> (<strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold"
            >jQuery</strong
          >, you know) and the beginning of the mobile development
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          After that, I was <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">CTO</strong> at another marketing agency. I learned
          a lot about marketing (email marketing, how to set a campaign, conversion pixels, how to set a target, etc).
          Also, I managed all about the developments for the clients of the agency (how to make
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">DevOps</strong> for each project, how to manage a team, Agile
          processes, how to improve the performance of the build of each project since testing, use of which
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">CSS preprocessor</strong>, to the use of what programming language for
          their CMS ). That experience formed me as a manager and was full of challenges. Sometimes very frustrating,
          but I learn a lot.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          Later, I worked as a full-stack developer at another marketing agency. I introduced the use of
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Laravel</strong> for 5 of their developments (one of them at my
          charge) with a little team of 5 devs. I can say that was my first touch with
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold"> Laravel</strong> but every development was a success. (I tend to
          learn quite fast). I started with <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Laravel 5.0</strong> and the use of
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Docker</strong> and finished with the use of
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">CD/CI</strong> and
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">AWS</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          With more self-confidence, I started a freelance job doing a couple of projects. A couple of them as a
          consultor (<strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Laravel, Angular JS, Vue</strong>), and one development
          using <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Laravel</strong> with
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">web components</strong> (<strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold"
            >Laravel, Vue, AWS</strong
          >). That time was full of self-knowledge about how to work remotely, how to self-organized, and how to be a
          student of new technologies in my free time as a hobby.
