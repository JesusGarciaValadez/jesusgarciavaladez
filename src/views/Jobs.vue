          Iâ€™m a developer since 2009 at a marketing and development agency.
          I started as a front-end dev but, I started to dig in the back-end since then.
          I learned about <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">JavaScript</strong>
          (jQuery, you know) and the beginning of the mobile development
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-semibold">(HTML5, CSS3, Raw PHP, MySQL)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          After that, I was CTO at another marketing agency.
          I learned a lot about marketing (email marketing, how to set a campaign, conversion
          pixels, how to set a target, etc).
          Also I managed all about the developments for the clients of the agency
          (<strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">how to make DevOps for each project, how to
          manage a team, Agile processes, how to better perform the build of each project since
          testing each CSS preprocessor to the use back-end CMS</strong>).
          That experience formed me as a manager and was full of challenges.
          Sometimes very frustrating, but I learn a lot.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          Later, I work as a full-stack developer.
          I introduced the use of <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Laravel</strong> for a 5
          of developments at my charge with a little team of fellow devs.
          I can say that that was my first touch with Laravel but every development was a success.
          (I tend to learn quite fast).
          I start with <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Laravel 5.0</strong> and the use of
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Docker</strong> and finishing with the use of
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">CD/CI</strong> and
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">AWS.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          With more self-confidence, I start a freelance job doing a couple of projects, a couple
          of their as a consultor (<strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Laravel, Angular JS, Vue
        </strong>) and one development using
          <strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Laravel</strong> with web components
          (<strong class="text-blue-700 font-bold">Laravel, Vue, AWS</strong>).
          That time was full of self-knowledge about how to work remotely, how to organize me,
          and how to be a student of new technologies in my free time as a hobby.
