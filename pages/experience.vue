          Iâ€™m a developer since 2009 at a marketing and development agency. I
          begin as a front-end dev but, I also did some basic back-end tasks
          since then. I learned about
          <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">JavaScript</strong> (<strong
            class="text-gray-500 font-bold"
            >jQuery</strong
          >, you know) and the beginning of the mobile development
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          After that, I was
          <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">CTO</strong> at another
          marketing agency. I learned a lot about marketing (email marketing,
          how to set a campaign, conversion pixels, how to set a target, etc).
          Also, I managed all about the developments for the clients of the
          agency (how to make
          <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">DevOps</strong> for each
          project, how to manage a team, Agile processes, how to improve the
          performance of the build of each project since testing, use of which
          <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">CSS preprocessor</strong>, to
          the use of what programming language for their CMS ). That experience
          formed me as a manager and was full of challenges. Sometimes very
          frustrating, but I learn a lot.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          Later, I worked as a full-stack developer at another marketing agency.
          I introduced the use of
          <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">Laravel</strong> for 5 of
          their developments (one of them at my charge) with a little team of 5
          devs. I can say that was my first touch with
          <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold"> Laravel</strong> but every
          development was a success. (I tend to learn quite fast). I started
          with <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">Laravel 5.0</strong> and
          the use of <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">Docker</strong> and
          finished with the use of
          <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">CD/CI</strong> and
          <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">AWS</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          With more self-confidence, I started a freelance job doing a couple of
          projects. A couple of them as a consultor (<strong
            class="text-gray-500 font-bold"
            >Laravel, Angular JS, Vue</strong
          >), and one development using
          <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">Laravel</strong> with
          <strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">web components</strong>
          (<strong class="text-gray-500 font-bold">Laravel, Vue, AWS</strong>).
          That time was full of self-knowledge about how to work remotely, how
          to self-organized, and how to be a student of new technologies in my
          free time as a hobby.
