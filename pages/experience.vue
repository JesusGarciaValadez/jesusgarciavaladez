          I’m a developer since 2009. I started at <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">Ingenia Agency</strong>
          (formerly <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">Ingenia Group</strong>), a marketing and development
          agency, as a front-end dev but, I also did some basic back-end tasks since then.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          After that, I was CTO at <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">CMV | R&R</strong>
          (formerly just <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">CMV</strong>), another marketing agency.
          Also, I managed all the aspects of the developments for the clients of the agency.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          Later, I worked as a full-stack developer at <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">Lunave Multimedios
          </strong>, another marketing agency. I introduced Laravel for 5 in some developments
          (one of them at my charge) with a little team of 5 devs. I can say that it was my first touch with Laravel,
          but every development was a success. (I tend to learn quite fast).
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          With more self-confidence, I started a <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">freelance job</strong>
          doing a couple of projects. Some of my work was making a CMS for
          <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">Rolve Inmobiliaria</strong>. Another one was as a consultor at
          <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">Legalario</strong> (A Mexican startup that created legal
          documents), giving some advice and consultatory. And one development and consultatory using Laravel with web
          components for <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">Logikoss</strong> (A Mexican startup that does a
          lot about package logistics management).
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          That time was full of self-knowledge about working remotely, how to self-organized, and how to be a student of
          new technologies in my free time as a hobby.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          Today I’m a Senior Software Engineer II at <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">Linio Mexico</strong>.
          <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">Linio</strong> is an eCommerce startup that was bought by
          <strong class="text-sky-700 font-bold">Falabella</strong> in 2018. Currently, I’m doing back-end tasks
          for the Finance, Invoice, and Conciliation Squad to make the invoice process quite fast and to reduce the
          invoice errors and rejections rate at 94% in the last year.
